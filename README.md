## About

Twitch Split Viewer is a web application that allows users to watch multiple Twitch streams simultaneously in a split-screen layout. This project is made for [Stream Track](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stream-track/gefllgcgjeonfffgimbgfkpkpckhppdg) where the chrome extension will detect the stream title of a Twitch stream and inject a button at the end of the title to open all the stream with Twitch Split Viewer. Twitch Split Viewer also works by itself as a standalone website.

## Getting Started

To use Twitch Split Viewer, simply visit the website and enter the names of the Twitch streams you want to watch. You can also load multiple streams by adding the list of channels in the URL like so:

[https://twitchsplitviewer.pages.dev/](https://twitchsplitviewer.pages.dev/)`?channels=channel1,channel2,channel3`

## Features

- Watch up to 12 Twitch streams simultaneously in a split-screen view
- Easily switch between different chat rooms for each stream
- Input multiple streamers and watch them side-by-side
